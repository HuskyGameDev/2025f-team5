AimAlgam is a top-down rougelike bullet hell loosely based off Enter the Gungeon and other similar games. It is still heavily in development, and will hopefully be completed by May 2026.

Controls: WASD to move the character, space to dash, left click to shoot, and N to open the DNA menu.

Installation: There is currently no simple installation/executable to play the game.


AimAlgam is being developed through the Husky Game Development enterprise at Michigan Technological University.
